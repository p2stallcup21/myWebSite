<p> Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or AOC, is the US Representative for New York's 14th congressional district. As someone who was born into an ordinary, low-income family, AOC is dedicated to fighting income inequality, supporting the working class over big businesses, pushing Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, and advocating for all sorts of important social justice issues relating to race, sexuality, the environment, and more. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

<p> Whenever I see videos of AOC I am inspired because she is extremely confident, well-spoken, and is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in. There are a lot of things I believe in that I would like to support and speak about, but I lack the confidence or tough skin needed to do so. AOC was able to climb to a position of influence at such a young age, and as a woman of color in a government dominated by white men, due to her motivation, leadership, and perseverence. I hope one day I can have even a fraction of the confidence and determination she has.
